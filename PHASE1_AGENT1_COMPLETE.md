- [x] Updated `python/tools/memory_load.py` with hybrid search and entity/relationship search
- [x] Created `python/tools/memory_insights.py` for system statistics and insights

### ✅ Testing & Validation
- [x] Created `test_enhanced_memory.py` for comprehensive system testing
- [x] Created `validate_enhanced_memory.py` for file structure validation
- [x] Created `start_enhanced_memory.py` for automated setup
- [x] All validation checks pass successfully

### ✅ Documentation
- [x] Created `ENHANCED_MEMORY_README.md` with complete usage guide
- [x] Updated service configurations to always pull latest versions
- [x] Comprehensive setup and troubleshooting instructions

## 🚀 Enhanced Features Implemented

### Rich Memory Storage
- **Vector similarity search** via Qdrant (production-ready)
- **Entity extraction** via Cognee (automatic from conversations)
- **Knowledge graph relationships** via Graphiti (temporal context)
- **Namespace isolation** per agent (`agent_{number}_{memory_subdir}`)
- **Hybrid search** across all three systems

### Enhanced Feedback
Memory save operations now return:
- Document ID and episode ID
- Number of entities extracted
- Number of relationships mapped
- Knowledge graph update status
- Entity details (names, types, descriptions)
- Relationship mappings (source → relationship → target)
- Automatic summaries

### Advanced Search Capabilities
- **Hybrid search**: Combines vector, graph, and knowledge search
- **Entity search**: Find specific entities by name
- **Relationship search**: Explore entity relationships
- **Multi-source results**: Results from Qdrant, Graphiti, and Cognee
- **Rich metadata**: Source information and confidence scores

### System Insights
New `memory_insights` tool provides:
- Vector database statistics
- Knowledge graph metrics
- Entity and relationship counts
- System health and performance data
- Recommendations for optimization

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Services
- **Qdrant** (localhost:6333): Vector database for semantic search
- **Neo4j** (localhost:7687): Graph database for relationships and temporal context

### Memory Components
```
EnhancedMemory
├── QdrantVectorDB (vector similarity)
├── GraphitiService (knowledge graphs)
├── CogneeProcessor (entity extraction)
└── HybridSearchEngine (unified search)
```

### Agent Integration
- Each agent gets isolated collections/namespaces
- Automatic entity extraction on memory operations
- Rich feedback with relationship mapping
- Full backward compatibility with existing memory interface

## ✅ Validation Results

All validation checks pass:
- [x] **File Structure**: All 15 required files present
- [x] **Docker Configuration**: Qdrant and Neo4j services configured with latest images
- [x] **Requirements**: All enhanced dependencies specified with latest versions
- [x] **Memory Tools**: All tools updated to use EnhancedMemory
- [x] **Documentation**: Complete with all required sections

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

- [x] Databases start successfully with `docker-compose up -d`
- [x] Qdrant collections created for agent namespaces
- [x] Neo4j schema initialized for Graphiti and Cognee
- [x] Memory save returns entity extraction results
- [x] Memory search works across all three systems
- [x] Performance: Memory operations complete efficiently
- [x] Rich feedback with entity and relationship information
- [x] Namespace isolation between agents
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained

## 🔄 Graceful Fallbacks

The system includes graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies:
- Works with or without enhanced packages installed
- Degrades gracefully if databases unavailable
- Maintains compatibility with original memory system
- Clear error messages and fallback notifications

## 📊 Service Versions (Always Latest)

Updated all configurations to pull newest versions:
- `qdrant/qdrant:latest`
- `neo4j:latest`
- `qdrant-client>=1.12.0`
- `graphiti-core>=0.3.0`
- `cognee>=0.1.0`
- `neo4j>=5.0.0`
