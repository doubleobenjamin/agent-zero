# Agent Zero Refactoring PRD: Graphiti + Agno + ACI Integration

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the comprehensive refactoring of Agent Zero to integrate three powerful open-source frameworks:
- **Graphiti**: Temporal knowledge graph for advanced memory management
- **Agno**: Multi-agent orchestration and team coordination
- **ACI**: Standardized tool interfaces via MCP servers

The refactoring transforms Agent Zero from a hierarchical agent system into a sophisticated agent builder/orchestrator capable of managing complex workflows, persistent agents, and multi-agent systems with shared and isolated memory contexts.

## Current State Analysis

### Agent Zero Current Architecture
- **Memory System**: File-based history with basic FAISS vector storage
- **Agent Management**: Simple hierarchical subordinate agent spawning via `call_subordinate` tool
- **Tool System**: Custom Python tool classes with direct API integrations
- **Decision Making**: LLM-based tool selection and subordinate delegation
- **Context Management**: Basic data object sharing between superior/subordinate agents

### Integration Targets

#### Graphiti Capabilities
- Temporal knowledge graphs with bi-temporal data model
- Real-time incremental updates without batch recomputation
- Hybrid retrieval (semantic + BM25 + graph traversal)
- Namespace-based multi-tenancy for agent isolation
- Neo4j backend with efficient querying

#### Agno Capabilities
- Advanced multi-agent teams with 3 coordination modes (route, coordinate, collaborate)
- Persistent agent lifecycle management
- Shared memory and context between team members
- Built-in reasoning and tool integration
- Scalable agent spawning and management

#### ACI Capabilities
- 600+ standardized tools via MCP servers
- Multi-tenant authentication and permissions
- Dynamic tool discovery and registration
- Unified API interface for all external services
- Intent-aware tool access

## High-Level Goals

### 1. Memory System Transformation
**Replace** Agent Zero's file/vector-based memory with Graphiti knowledge graphs:
- Each agent gets its own namespace for private memory
- Shared namespaces enable cross-agent collaboration
- Temporal queries for historical context retrieval
- Persistent memory across agent restarts

### 2. Agent Orchestration Enhancement
**Upgrade** from simple subordinate spawning to Agno-powered multi-agent systems:
- Persistent expert agents with specialized knowledge domains
- Ephemeral helper agents for one-off tasks
- Team coordination modes for complex workflows
- Agent lifecycle management and reuse

### 3. Tool Interface Standardization
**Replace** custom tool implementations with ACI MCP servers:
- Unified interface for all external APIs
- Centralized authentication and rate limiting
- Dynamic tool discovery and registration
- Consistent error handling and retry logic

### 4. Decision Framework Evolution
**Enhance** Agent Zero's decision-making to orchestrate complex workflows:
- Intelligent agent selection and team composition
- Workflow planning and execution monitoring
- Resource allocation and load balancing
- Failure recovery and retry strategies
