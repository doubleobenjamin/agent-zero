# Phase 1, Agent 6: Integration Testing & Validation

This directory contains the comprehensive testing and validation framework for all enhanced systems implemented in Phase 1 of the Agent Zero enhancement project.

## 🎯 Overview

The testing framework validates the integration and performance of:
- **Agent 1**: Enhanced Memory System (Qdrant + Neo4j + hybrid search)
- **Agent 2**: Multi-Agent Orchestration (Agno-based coordination)
- **Agent 3**: ACI Tool Interface (600+ tools with intelligent discovery)
- **Agent 4**: Enhanced Prompt System (21 variables, multi-modal support)
- **Agent 5**: Configuration & Extension System (lifecycle extensions)
- **Agent 6**: Integration Testing & Validation (this framework)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Start databases**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name agent-zero-qdrant -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant:latest
   docker run -d --name agent-zero-neo4j -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password neo4j:latest
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install qdrant-client neo4j langchain-community langchain-core langchain-openai nest-asyncio webcolors
   ```

### Running Tests

#### Simple Validation (Recommended for quick checks)
```bash
python simple_validation.py
```

#### Comprehensive Validation (Full test suite)
```bash
python tests/integration_validation.py
```

#### Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Enhanced Memory System
python tests/enhanced/test_memory_system.py

# Multi-Agent Orchestration
python tests/enhanced/test_orchestration.py

# ACI Tool Interface
python tests/enhanced/test_tool_interface.py

# End-to-End Integration
python tests/enhanced/test_integration.py
```

#### Performance Benchmarks
```bash
# Memory System Performance
python tests/performance/benchmark_memory.py

# Orchestration Performance
python tests/performance/benchmark_orchestration.py

# Tool Interface Performance
python tests/performance/benchmark_tools.py
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if containers are running
docker ps

# Restart containers if needed
docker restart agent-zero-qdrant agent-zero-neo4j

# Check connectivity
curl http://localhost:6333/health
curl http://localhost:7474
```

#### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install additional test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
```

#### Import Errors
```bash
# Ensure project root is in Python path
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)"

# Or run from project root
cd /path/to/agent-zero
python tests/integration_validation.py
```

### Test Failures

#### Memory System Tests
- Ensure Qdrant and Neo4j are running and accessible
- Check that required Python packages are installed
- Verify database schemas are properly initialized

#### Orchestration Tests
- Agno framework is optional - tests should pass with graceful fallbacks
- Check that agent configuration is properly set up
- Verify task analysis components are available

#### Tool Interface Tests
- ACI tools are optional - tests validate interface availability
- Check ACI configuration if full functionality is needed
- Verify tool discovery mechanisms work correctly

## 📈 Monitoring and Reporting
